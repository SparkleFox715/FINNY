# WebCodeFINNY
FINNY the AI Financial Analyst will help you any where at any time. Just ask him what you want and edit the settings to your liking. He can get data, but the most important of all is he can write you reports that you want for stocks and commodities!

#### Need Work
1. For now locally host with python to get SEC data from the API. Once we can scrape all the data we will be able to create a report to the user's liking.
2. Download Node for the financial data labeled "data" so that we can get the yahoofinance package
3. add jsPDF library didn't test yet if already in but the code is there for it(removed functinoality to download for now)
4. going to edit this code later so the white page will fill up the rest of the page and have the title of the stock symbol with a physical download button instead of the pdf automaticaly downloading(although this function seems to not be working)
5. the page generation for aireport might have an error but will confirm after we get the data on it
